# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm William
I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Cambridge with a passion for solving problems by developing efficient, robust and maintainable software, built with performance in mind. I thrive on projects where every millisecond counts, and I find immense satisfaction in delivering performant and reliable solutions across diverse domains, from systems development to web applications, back-end infrastructure to mobile apps.
