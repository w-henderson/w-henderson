# 👋 Hi there, I'm William
I'm William Henderson, and I'm a Computer Science student and Software Developer from the United Kingdom. I'm passionate about building efficient, robust and beautiful applications in a variety of fields. Over my decade of software development I've used many languages, but my favourites are Rust and TypeScript. I've developed and maintained many projects which, between them, have accumulated over 20,000 downloads and remain in use every day across the world.
