I'm William Henderson, and I'm a Computer Science student and Software Developer. I've been programming for the best part of a decade using numerous languages, but my favourites are Python, TypeScript, and more recently, Rust. I've developed and maintained a wide variety of projects in a number of fields which, between them, have accumulated over 12000 downloads and remain in use every day across the world.
